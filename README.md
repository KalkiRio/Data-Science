# Data-Science Repository Documentation

## Overview

**Data-Science** is a collection of Jupyter Notebook-based mini projects, developed as a 3-day exercise. Each notebook focuses on a distinct data science task, primarily visual and geographic data analysis, and is designed to be run on Google Colab or any Jupyter environment.

## Repository Structure

- `collegeloc.ipynb`: Maps the location of a college on a map.
- `digital elevation.ipynb`: Analyzes and visualizes the elevation data of the state of Haryana, India, including district and college mappings.
- `orbitearth.ipynb`: Simulates and visualizes the elliptical orbit of Earth around the Sun.
- `README.md`: Provides a brief summary of the repository and describes the three main notebooks.

## Project Descriptions

### 1. College Location Mapping (`collegeloc.ipynb`)
- **Purpose:** Visualize the geographic location of a specific college on a map.
- **Typical Workflow:** Reads location data and uses mapping libraries to plot the college's position.
- **Use Cases:** Useful for educational mapping, presentations, or initial GIS tasks.

### 2. Digital Elevation Mapping (`digital elevation.ipynb`)
- **Purpose:** Visualize elevation data for Haryana, India, with overlays for districts and college locations.
- **Typical Workflow:** 
  - Loads elevation data.
  - Maps the elevation for each district.
  - Overlays college locations on the elevation map.
- **Use Cases:** Useful for geographical analysis, environmental studies, and planning.

### 3. Earth's Orbit Simulation (`orbitearth.ipynb`)
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates the elliptical orbit of Earth around the Sun using numerical simulation and visualization.
- **Technical Details:**
  - Uses NumPy and matplotlib for calculations and plotting.
  - Simulates random noise to represent orbit variance.
  - Fits an ellipse to generated data points and overlays the sun and Earth.
- **Sample Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    N = 500
    t = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, N)
    x = 5 * np.cos(t) + 0.4 * np.random.normal(size=N) + 1
    y = 4 * np.sin(t) + 0.4 * np.random.normal(size=N)

    plt.plot(x, y, '.k')
    # Centering, SVD, ellipse fitting, and plotting continues...
    ```

## Dependencies

- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook** (or Google Colab)
- **Main Libraries Used:**
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - Additional mapping libraries (such as `folium` or `geopandas`) may be required for geographic visualization notebooks.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KalkiRio/Data-Science.git
    cd Data-Science
    ```

2. **Open Notebooks**
   - Open the desired notebook (`collegeloc.ipynb`, `digital elevation.ipynb`, or `orbitearth.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

3. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
    ```
    - For mapping notebooks, install additional required libraries as indicated by notebook import errors or documentation.

4. **Run Cells**
   - Execute each cell in order to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Intended Usage

- **Educational Purposes:** For students or instructors looking for practical examples of data science visualization.
- **Geographic Data Exploration:** For those interested in mapping and elevation data analysis.
- **Orbital Mechanics Demonstration:** For visualizing and understanding Earth's orbital dynamics in a simple, interactive way.
